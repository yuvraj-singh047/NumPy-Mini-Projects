# NumPy Mini Projects ðŸš€

This repository contains small, beginner-friendly projects built using **NumPy**.  
These projects helped me learn **NumPy basics, Boolean Masking, Array Manipulation, and Data Analysis** â€” all essential for AIML (Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning).

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included:
### âœ… Project 1: Grade Calculator
- Simulates grades of 50 students based on random scores.
- Uses Boolean Masking & NumPy operations to categorize students into grades A, B, C, D, F.
- Calculates grade distribution and lists Grade A students.

### âœ… Project 2: E-Commerce Sales Analyzer
- Simulates daily sales for an e-commerce store over 30 days.
- Calculates total sales, average daily sales, highest and lowest sale days.
- Normalizes sales data and lists days with high sales using Boolean Masking.

### âœ… Project 3: Image Simulator
- Will simulate a grayscale image using random pixel intensities.
- Will apply photo-negative effects and analyze image brightness.

## ðŸ’¡ Why These Projects?
I wanted to:
- Practice NumPy in a fun, hands-on way.
- Build confidence before moving to Pandas and ML.
- Share my learning journey publicly through GitHub.

---

## âš¡ Tech Used:
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Future Plans:
- Add more NumPy and Pandas mini projects.
- Explore real-world datasets after Pandas.
